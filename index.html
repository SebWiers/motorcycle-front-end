<h2>Motorcycle Front Ends</h2>
<p>MFE is a collection of work-in-progress tools for motorcycle front end setup and design.  Current tools are intended to calculate static geometry, 
such as determining trail given a known setup, or taking a known setup and making a change to the fork length and calculating the new rake and trail.
<p>All of these tools are exploratory; as I develop my skills (both mathematical and as a programmer) new versions will evolve.  
I will attempt to use sensible version numbering (creating a new version if any useful features are added or removed) and maintain links to all "released" versions.
<p>My eventual goal is to produce web apps that can determine and graph kinematic behaviors of various motorcyle front end setups that use sliding and / or pivoting 
elements and springs / dampers to constrain vertical wheel motion.  This would include (but not be limited to) normal telescompic forks, "springer" forks, "girders", 
and more exotic setups like BMW's Telelever and Duolever, the Yamaha GTS, and Bimota Tesi / Vyrus hub steering.
<p>If you have an interest in helping with this project by offering mathematical or programming advice or assistance, 
please contact me by creating an issue via my <a href="https://github.com/SebWiers/motorcycle-front-end">Github Repo!</a>

<dt>Wheelbase and Trail
<dd>My first attempts, learning to use the HTML canvas and do some useful trigonometry.  I managed this pretty quickly without using any librarys, 
but am pushing up against the limits of spaghetti code and manual data structuring even with good functional blocking and JSON data.
